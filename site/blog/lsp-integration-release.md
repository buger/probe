# Introducing LSP Integration: Advanced Code Intelligence for Probe

We're excited to announce a major enhancement to Probe: **full Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration**. This powerful feature brings IDE-level code intelligence to Probe's command-line interface, enabling deeper code analysis and understanding across multiple programming languages.

## What is LSP?

The Language Server Protocol, originally developed by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code, provides a standard way for tools to communicate with language-specific servers that understand code semantics. This means Probe can now leverage the same powerful analysis engines that power modern IDEs.

## Key Features

### üîç Call Hierarchy Analysis

One of the most powerful features is call hierarchy analysis. When extracting code with Probe, you can now see:

- **Incoming Calls**: Which functions call the target function
- **Outgoing Calls**: Which functions the target calls

```bash
# Extract a function with full call hierarchy
probe extract src/main.rs#calculate_result --lsp

# Output includes:
# LSP Information:
#   Incoming Calls:
#     - main (file:///src/main.rs:10)
#     - test_calculate (file:///src/tests.rs:25)
#   Outgoing Calls:
#     - perform_calculation (file:///src/main.rs:50)
#     - apply_modifier (file:///src/main.rs:60)
```

This is invaluable for understanding code dependencies and impact analysis when refactoring.

### üöÄ High-Performance Daemon Architecture

We've implemented a sophisticated daemon architecture that:

- **Maintains server pools** for each language
- **Reuses warm servers** for instant responses
- **Handles concurrent requests** efficiently
- **Manages server lifecycle** automatically

The daemon runs in the background and manages all language servers, eliminating startup overhead and maintaining indexed code state across requests.

### üìä In-Memory Logging System

Instead of writing logs to files (which can have permission issues), we've implemented an innovative in-memory circular buffer system:

- Stores last 1000 log entries in memory
- Zero file I/O overhead
- No permission issues
- Real-time log following with `--follow`

```bash
# View recent logs
probe lsp logs

# Follow logs in real-time
probe lsp logs --follow

# Get specific number of entries
probe lsp logs -n 100
```

### üåç Multi-Language Support

Currently supported languages include:

- **Rust** (rust-analyzer)
- **Python** (pylsp)
- **Go** (gopls)
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (typescript-language-server)
- **Java** (jdtls)
- **C/C++** (clangd)

Each language server is automatically detected and managed by the daemon.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Overview

The LSP integration consists of several key components:

1. **LSP Daemon**: A persistent service managing language servers
2. **Server Manager**: Handles server pools and lifecycle
3. **IPC Communication**: Fast Unix sockets (macOS/Linux) or named pipes (Windows)
4. **Protocol Layer**: Strongly-typed request/response system

### Performance Optimizations

We've implemented several optimizations for production use:

- **Server pooling**: Reuse warm servers instead of spawning new ones
- **Workspace caching**: Maintain indexed state across requests
- **Lazy initialization**: Servers start only when needed
- **Circular buffer logging**: Bounded memory usage for logs

### Real-World Performance

In our benchmarks with a Rust project containing 400+ dependencies:

- First request: 10-15 seconds (includes indexing)
- Subsequent requests: < 1 second
- Memory usage: Stable at ~200MB per language server
- Concurrent requests: Handled without blocking

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the daemon (happens automatically)
probe lsp start

# Extract code with LSP features
probe extract src/main.rs#my_function --lsp

# Check daemon status
probe lsp status

# View logs for debugging
probe lsp logs
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# Start daemon in foreground for debugging
probe lsp start -f --log-level debug

# Follow logs in real-time
probe lsp logs --follow

# Restart daemon to clear state
probe lsp restart
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Call Hierarchy Resolution

The implementation correctly handles both incoming and outgoing calls by:

1. Sending `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy` to identify the target
2. Requesting `callHierarchy/incomingCalls` for callers
3. Requesting `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` for callees
4. Parsing and formatting results with file locations

### Robust Error Handling

- Automatic daemon startup if not running
- Graceful handling of server crashes
- Timeout protection for slow operations
- Clear error messages for debugging

### Memory-Safe Logging

The in-memory logging system uses:
- `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<LogEntry>>>` for thread-safe access
- Circular buffer limiting entries to 1000
- Custom tracing layer capturing all events
- Zero file I/O for better performance

## Use Cases

### 1. Code Review and Understanding

When reviewing pull requests or understanding unfamiliar code:
```bash
# See what calls this function and what it calls
probe extract src/auth/login.rs#validate_user --lsp
```

### 2. Refactoring Impact Analysis

Before refactoring, understand dependencies:
```bash
# Check all callers before changing function signature
probe extract src/api/handler.rs#process_request --lsp
```

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis

Identify which tests call specific functions:
```bash
# Find test functions calling production code
probe extract src/core/engine.rs#execute --lsp | grep test_
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

Extract functions with full context for documentation:
```bash
# Generate comprehensive function documentation
probe extract src/lib.rs#public_api --lsp > docs/api.md
```

## Performance Comparison

| Operation | Without LSP | With LSP (cold) | With LSP (warm) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Extract function | 50ms | 10-15s | 200ms |
| Show context | 100ms | 10-15s | 300ms |
| Multiple extracts | 500ms | 15s | 1s |

The initial indexing cost is amortized across multiple operations, making LSP integration highly efficient for sustained use.

## Future Roadmap

We're planning several enhancements:

- **Go-to Definition**: Navigate to symbol definitions
- **Find References**: Locate all usages of symbols
- **Hover Documentation**: Inline documentation display
- **Code Completion**: Suggestions for AI assistants
- **Rename Refactoring**: Safe symbol renaming
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring suggestions

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Stdin Deadlock Prevention

We solved complex async I/O issues with language servers by:
- Proper mutex handling in async contexts
- Non-blocking message passing
- Timeout protection on all operations

### 2. Response Disambiguation

LSP servers can send both requests and responses with the same ID. We solved this by:
- Checking for `method` field presence
- Proper response type validation
- Handling server-initiated requests

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

The implementation works seamlessly across platforms:
- Unix domain sockets on macOS/Linux
- Named pipes on Windows
- Platform-specific path handling

## Conclusion

The LSP integration represents a significant leap forward for Probe, bringing IDE-level code intelligence to the command line. Whether you're analyzing code dependencies, understanding unfamiliar codebases, or building AI-powered development tools, the LSP features provide the semantic understanding needed for advanced code analysis.

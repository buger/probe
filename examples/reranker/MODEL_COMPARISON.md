# Model Comparison Results

## Summary

We successfully added support for two additional MS-MARCO cross-encoder models:
- `ms-marco-minilm-l6` (22.7M parameters)
- `ms-marco-minilm-l12` (33.4M parameters)

## Test Results

### TinyBERT-L-2 (4.4M params)
With different questions, the top 3 results were **identical**, showing poor discrimination.

### MiniLM-L-6 (22.7M params)
With different questions, we see **significant differences** in the top 10 results:

**Relevant Question**: "how does authentication work"
- TOKENIZATION_GUIDE.md appears first (contains auth examples)
- Different ordering of results
- Some unique results that don't appear with nonsense query

**Nonsense Question**: "foobar random nonsense gibberish"
- Different top result (README.md)
- Several different files in top 10 (cli-mode.md, output-formats.md, advanced-cli.md)
- Different ordering throughout

## Usage

```bash
# TinyBERT (fastest, least accurate)
probe search "auth" . --reranker ms-marco-tinybert --question "how does auth work"

# MiniLM-L6 (balanced - RECOMMENDED)
probe search "auth" . --reranker ms-marco-minilm-l6 --question "how does auth work"

# MiniLM-L12 (most accurate, slower)
probe search "auth" . --reranker ms-marco-minilm-l12 --question "how does auth work"
```

## Performance

Typical search times on the test repository:
- TinyBERT: ~1.1s
- MiniLM-L6: ~15.5s
- MiniLM-L12: ~22s (estimated)

## Recommendations

1. **Use MiniLM-L6 as default** for BERT reranking - it provides much better semantic understanding
2. **TinyBERT should only be used** when speed is critical and approximate ranking is acceptable
3. **MiniLM-L12 for production** when quality matters most

## Implementation Details

The implementation:
- Automatically downloads models from HuggingFace on first use
- Caches models locally in `examples/reranker/models/`
- Uses the same cross-encoder architecture for all models
- Properly handles tokenization with `encode_pair()`
- Maintains backward compatibility
